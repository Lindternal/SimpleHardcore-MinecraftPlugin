## About this plugin
This plugin limits the number of lives each player has (by default everyone has 3 lives).

Admins can change players' lives using commands (use "/sh help" to get a list of commands).

Also, the plugin adds a store with perks that can be purchased with the playerâ€™s experience. All perks are reset if the player dies.

The experience system has been changed. Now each level requires 100XP.

## Known Issues
- Recovery Compass doesn't work at all (I won't fix it, cause it's a feature, not a bug. And... it's hardcore after all).
